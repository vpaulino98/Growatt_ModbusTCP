## 🐛 Bug Fixes: SPF AC Charge/Discharge Energy Sensors + Log Noise Reduction

**Fixed (Issue #163):**
- SPF AC Charge Energy Today/Total sensors showing 0.00 (should show same values as Battery Charge sensors)
- SPF AC Discharge Energy Today/Total sensors showing 0.00 (registers 64-67)
- Noisy WARNING log message for SPF users: "load_energy_today_low register not found"

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.6:

#### 1. 🔧 Fixed SPF AC Charge/Discharge Energy Sensors

**Root Cause:** SPF uses different register names than WIT for the same energy measurements, causing "AC Charge/Discharge Energy" sensors to show 0.00 even though the data exists.

**Register Name Differences:**
- **WIT:** Uses `ac_charge_energy_*` and `ac_discharge_energy_*` register names
- **SPF:** Uses `charge_energy_*` (56-59) and `ac_discharge_energy_*` (64-67) register names
- Same data, different naming convention

**Affected sensors (now fixed):**
- `ac_charge_energy_today` - Now populated from SPF's `charge_energy_today` (registers 56-57)
- `ac_charge_energy_total` - Now populated from SPF's `charge_energy_total` (registers 58-59)
- `ac_discharge_energy_today` - Now reads from registers 64-65
- `ac_discharge_energy_total` - Now reads from registers 66-67

**The Fix:**
1. **AC Charge Energy**: SPF now populates BOTH `charge_energy_*` AND `ac_charge_energy_*` fields from the same registers (56-59)
2. **AC Discharge Energy**: Added missing register reading code for registers 64-67
3. **WIT compatibility**: WIT-specific register names still work for WIT inverters

**Impact:**
- ✅ SPF users will now see actual values in ALL "AC Charge/Discharge Energy" sensors
- ✅ "AC Charge Energy" sensors will match "Battery Charge" sensors (same data source)
- ✅ "AC Discharge Energy" sensors will show battery → load energy flow
- ✅ Complete energy tracking for SPF 6000 ES Plus and similar models

**What You'll See After Upgrade (SPF users):**
- "Battery Charge Today" = 0.80 kWh ✅ (working before)
- "AC Charge Energy Today" = 0.80 kWh ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "Battery Charge Total" = 446.90 kWh ✅ (working before)
- "AC Charge Energy Total" = 446.90 kWh ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "AC Discharge Energy Today" = actual value ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)
- "AC Discharge Energy Total" = actual value ✅ (NOW FIXED - was 0.00)

**Note:** Both "Battery Charge" and "AC Charge Energy" sensors track the same thing (grid/generator charging your battery) and will show identical values. This is normal - they're just different sensor names for the same SPF register data.

#### 2. 🔇 Reduced Log Noise for Off-Grid Inverters

**Issue:** SPF users (and other off-grid models) saw constant WARNING messages in Home Assistant logs:

    [SPF 3000-6000 ES PLUS@/dev/ttyACM0] load_energy_today_low register not found

**Root Cause:** The `load_energy_today` register is specific to **grid-tied inverters** (SPH/MIN/MID/MAX) that track energy consumed from grid by loads. **Off-grid inverters** like SPF don't have this register because they use different energy tracking:
- `ac_discharge_energy_*` - Battery → loads via inverter
- `op_discharge_energy_*` - Operational discharge energy

The code was logging this as a WARNING even though it's expected and harmless for off-grid models.

**The Fix:** Changed log level from WARNING to DEBUG with clarifying message: "register not found (expected for off-grid models like SPF)"

**Impact:**
- ✅ SPF users will no longer see noisy warnings in logs
- ✅ Debug logging still available if needed for troubleshooting
- ✅ No functional changes - purely cosmetic log improvement

---

### Migration Notes:

**No action required** - This is a bug fix release. Simply upgrade and:
- SPF AC Charge/Discharge Energy sensors will show correct values
- Log warnings for missing load_energy_today register will disappear

**For SPF users:**
- All four AC Charge/Discharge Energy sensors will now work
- "AC Charge Energy" sensors will show identical values to "Battery Charge" sensors (expected behavior)
- Log noise from missing grid-tied registers eliminated

---

### Files Changed:
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/growatt_modbus.py` - Added AC charge/discharge energy register mapping for SPF + reduced log noise
- `custom_components/growatt_modbus/manifest.json` - Version bump to 0.4.6
- `README.md` - Version badge updated to 0.4.6
- `RELEASENOTES.md` - Updated with v0.4.6 changes

# Release Notes - v0.4.5

## 🔥 CRITICAL Bug Fix: Serial Connection File Descriptor Leak

**Fixed:**
- **CRITICAL:** Serial connection file descriptor leak causing permanent integration failure after overnight offline periods

---

### What's Fixed in v0.4.5:

#### 1. 🔥 CRITICAL: Fixed Serial Connection File Descriptor Leak

**Root Cause:** When using USB-RS485 adapters (serial connection), failed connection attempts during offline periods (e.g., overnight when inverter is powered down) were not properly releasing the serial port file descriptor. Over hours of offline polling, hundreds of leaked file descriptors would accumulate until the system exhausted its limit.

**Symptoms:**
- Integration works fine initially
- Inverter goes offline (night time, powered down)
- After several hours, integration stops working completely
- Error in logs: `OSError: [Errno 24] No file descriptors available`
- Integration never recovers even when inverter comes back online
- **Inverter is actually online** (proven by Growatt cloud connectivity)
- Only fix is restarting Home Assistant

**Technical Details:**
The coordinator's `_fetch_data()` method had three critical flaws:
1. **No cleanup on failed connection** - When `connect()` failed, `disconnect()` was never called to release the serial port
2. **No cleanup before retry** - Each retry attempt would call `connect()` without first calling `disconnect()`, potentially creating multiple open file descriptors
3. **Silent exception handling** - Bare `except: pass` blocks hid disconnect failures

**Scenario Example:**
- Inverter offline 5pm-5am (12 hours)
- Offline polling every 300s = ~144 poll attempts
- Each attempt tries 3 connection retries = ~432 connection attempts
- Each leaked file descriptor accumulates
- At 5:12am when inverter wakes: errno 24 "No file descriptors available"
- Integration permanently broken until HA restart

**The Fix:**
1. **Always disconnect before connect** - Ensures clean state, prevents double-open
2. **Always disconnect after failed connect** - Releases file descriptors even on failure
3. **Proper error logging** - Replace bare `except: pass` with debug logging
4. **Connection state checking** - Skip `connect()` if already connected (prevents double-open)

**Files Changed:**
- `coordinator.py:482-537` - Added disconnect calls before/after every connect attempt
- `growatt_modbus.py:330-350` - Added `is_socket_open()` check to prevent double-connect
- `growatt_modbus.py:351-364` - Enhanced disconnect error logging with critical error detection

**Impact:**
- ✅ **ALL Serial/USB-RS485 users (ALL inverter models):** Integration now properly recovers from overnight offline periods
- ✅ **TCP users:** Not affected by the bug, but benefits from cleaner connection management
- ✅ **All inverter series (MIN/MID/MAX/MOD/SPH/SPF/WIT/MIX/SPA):** No more permanent failures when using serial connections
- ✅ **Logging:** Better visibility into connection lifecycle and resource leak issues

**Migration Notes:**
- No action required - fix is automatic
- If you experienced this issue, upgrade to v0.4.5 and restart Home Assistant once
- Monitor logs after upgrade - should see `Disconnected successfully` debug messages
- If you see `CRITICAL: File descriptor leak detected!` in logs after upgrade, please report the issue
